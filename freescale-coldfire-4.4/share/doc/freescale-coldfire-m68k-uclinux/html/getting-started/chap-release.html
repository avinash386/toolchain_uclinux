    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id284385"></a>A.1.1. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-53</h3></div></div></div><p><b><code class="option">@<em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em></code> fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed in the processing of
	  <code class="option">@<em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em></code>
	  command-line options by GCC, GDB, and other tools.
	  The bug caused any options in
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em> following a blank line
	  to be ignored.
        </p><p><b>Preprocessor error handling. </b>
	  The preprocessor now treats failing to find a file referenced
	  via <code class="literal">#include</code> as a fatal error.
	  
        </p><p><b>Stack unwinding bug fix. </b>
          A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect stack unwinding
	  information has been fixed.  The bug interfered with the
	  <span class="command"><strong>next</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>finish</strong></span> commands
	  when debugging, and could cause programs using C++
	  exception handling to crash.
        </p><p><b>ELF file corruption with <span class="command"><strong>strip</strong></span>. </b>
          A bug that caused <span class="command"><strong>strip</strong></span> to corrupt unusual
          ELF files has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GDB support for Cygwin pathnames. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's translation of Cygwin pathnames has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GCC internal compiler error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash when
	  optimizing code that casts between structure types and the
	  type of the first field.
        </p><p><b>ELF Program Headers. </b>
          The linker now better diagnoses errors in the usage of
          <code class="literal">FILEHDR</code> and <code class="literal">PHDRS</code>
          keywords in <code class="literal">PHDRS</code> command of linker
          scripts.  Refer to the linker manual for more information.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id284578"></a>A.1.2. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-28</h3></div></div></div><p><b>ColdFire MCF5441x support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now supports the Freescale MCF5441x (Modelo)
	  family of microprocessors.  To compile for these CPUs
	  use the <code class="option">-mcpu=54410</code>, <code class="option">-mcpu=54415</code>,
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=54416</code>, <code class="option">-mcpu=54417</code>, and
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=54418</code> command-line options.
        </p><p><b>Linux kernel headers update. </b>
          Linux kernel header files have been updated to version 2.6.30.
	  <span>Among other things this fixes
	    assembler failures with functions that convert integers
	    to different endianness.</span>
        </p><p><b>Optimizer improvements. </b>
	  When optimizing for speed, the compiler now uses improved
	  heuristics to limit certain types of optimizations that may
	  adversely affect both code size and speed.  This change also
	  makes it possible to produce better code when optimizing for
	  space rather than speed.
	</p><p><b>ColdFire MCF5445x support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now supports the Freescale MCF5445x (RedStripe)
	  family of microprocessors.  To compile for these CPUs
	  use the <code class="option">-mcpu=54450</code>, <code class="option">-mcpu=54451</code>,
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=54452</code>, <code class="option">-mcpu=54453</code>,
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=54454</code>, and <code class="option">-mcpu=54455</code>
	  command-line options.
        </p><p><b>Mixed PIC and non-PIC code. </b>
          The <span class="command"><strong>elf2flt</strong></span> utility, automatically run by
	  Sourcery G++ when linking uClinux applications, now gives an
	  error when an attempt is made to link mixed PIC and non-PIC
	  code, which is not supported on uClinux targets.  Formerly,
	  it silently produced an invalid executable in such cases.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20090630.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including support for multi-byte and
	  wide character sets and improved C++ template support.
	</p><p><b>GDB and third-party compilers. </b>
	  Some bugs that caused GDB to crash when debugging programs
	  compiled with third-party tools have been fixed.  These
	  bugs did not affect programs built with Sourcery G++.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging hardware watchpoint bug fix. </b>
          A GDB bug has been fixed that caused hardware watchpoint hits
          to be incorrectly reported in some cases.
        </p><p><b>GDB internal warning fix. </b>
	  A GDB bug has been fixed that caused warnings of the form
	  <code class="literal">warning: (Internal error: pc <em class="replaceable"><code>address
	  </code></em> in read in psymtab, but not in symtab.)</code>.
	</p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.19.51.20090709 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Code generation for string literals. </b>
	  A defect in the generation of code for string literals has
	  been corrected.  Multiple occurrences of the same string
	  literal in the same file sometimes resulted in incorrect code.
        </p><p><b>Configuration file required for Debug Sprite. </b>
          When invoking the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite from the command line,
          it is now required to specify a board configuration file argument.
          
	  This change eliminates a source of confusion and errors resulting
	  from accidental omission of the configuration file argument, since
	  recent improvements to debugger functionality depend on properties
	  specified in the configuration file.
	  Refer to <a class="xref" href="sprite.html" title="Chapter 5. Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite">Chapter 5, &#8220;Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite&#8221;</a> for more details on invoking the
	  Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite from the command line.
        </p><p><b>GDB segmentation fault bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite that sometimes
	  caused GDB to crash when inspecting register contents
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Register variable corruption. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code to be
          generated when the frame pointer or other special-use registers
          are used as explicit local register variables, introduced via the
          <code class="literal">asm</code> keyword on their declarations.
        </p><p><b>Startup code debugging fixes. </b>
          Two GDB bugs have been fixed that caused errors when
          debugging startup code.  One bug caused an internal error
          message; the other caused the error <code class="literal">Cannot find
          bounds of current function</code>.
        </p><p><b><code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code>
        optimization. </b>
          The <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code> optimization is
          now enabled by default at <code class="option">-O2</code> and higher
          optimization levels.
        </p><p><b>
	 Elimination of spurious warnings about <code class="constant">NULL</code>
        . </b>
	  The C++ compiler no longer issues spurious warnings about
	  comparisons between pointers to members and
	  <code class="constant">NULL</code>.
        </p><p><b>Vectorizer improvements. </b>
	  The compiler now generates improved code for accesses to static
	  nested array variables
	  (e.g. <code class="literal">static int foo[8][8];</code>).
        </p><p><b>uClibc upgrade. </b>
          uClibc has been updated to version 0.9.30 plus additional
          updates from the uclibc.org repository as of June 2009.
          Programs linked with uClibc shared libraries from a previous
          version of Sourcery G++ must be recompiled to run with the new
          version of uClibc.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.4.1. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire uClinux is now based on GCC version 4.4.1.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.3 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Linker map address sorting. </b>
          The map generated by the linker <code class="option">-Map</code> option
          now lists symbols sorted by address.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id285367"></a>A.1.3. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 4.3-209</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GDB <span class="command"><strong>finish</strong></span> internal error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused a GDB internal error when
	  using the <span class="command"><strong>finish</strong></span> command.  The bug occurred
	  when debugging optimized code.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.3.3. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire uClinux is now based on GCC version 4.3.3.
          This is a bug fix update to GCC.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.3.2 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>
	 Incorrect code when using <code class="option">-falign-labels</code>
        . </b>
	  A bug that caused the compiler to generate incorrect code
	  for <code class="code">switch</code> statements when the
          <code class="option">-falign-labels</code> option is used has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Reduced compilation time. </b>
	  Compilation and build times when using Sourcery G++ Lite are now
	  slightly faster.  This performance improvement is the result
	  of building the compilers and other host tools with a recent
          version of Sourcery G++, rather than an older GCC version.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error with <code class="option">-O3</code>
        or <code class="option">-fpredictive-commoning</code>. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler errors
          when compiling some code with <code class="option">-O3</code>
          or <code class="option">-fpredictive-commoning</code>.
        </p><p><b>C++ named operators bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash in
          some cases when the C++ operators <code class="code">and_eq</code>,
          <code class="code">bitand</code>, <code class="code">bitor</code>, <code class="code">compl</code>,
          <code class="code">not_eq</code>, <code class="code">or_eq</code> and
          <code class="code">xor_eq</code> were used in contexts where the
          preprocessor converts their names to strings.
        </p><p><b>Debug information for anonymous structure types. </b>
          A GCC bug in the generation of debug information for anonymous structure
          types in C++ code has been fixed.  The bug caused
          printing the type information for such structures in the debugger (via the
          <span class="command"><strong>ptype</strong></span> command) to fail with an error message.
        </p><p><b>Sprite's failure to reset the target. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that sometimes caused the Sourcery G++
	  Debug Sprite to fail to reset the target when using the
	  multiple sequential connection feature (enabled via the
	  <code class="option">-m</code> command-line option).  This problem was
	  specific to running the Debug Sprite on Microsoft Windows
	  hosts.
        </p><p><b>uClibc <code class="function">splice</code>,
               <code class="function">vmsplice</code> and
               <code class="function">tee</code> functions. </b>
          uClibc now provides the functions
          <code class="function">splice</code>, <code class="function">vmsplice</code>
          and <code class="function">tee</code>.
        </p><p><b>Installer fails during upgrade. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ installer for Microsoft Windows hosts could
	  fail during an upgrade while waiting for the previous
	  version to be uninstalled.  This bug has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Loop optimization improvements. </b>
          A new option, <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code>, has
          been added to the compiler.  Specifying this option enables an
          optimization that improves the performance of loops with index
          variables of integer types narrower than the target machine
          word size, such as <span class="type">char</span> or <span class="type">short</span>.
          This optimization also applies to <span class="type">int</span> on 64-bit
          targets.
        </p><p><b>Overloaded function resolution. </b>
	  The C++ compiler now correctly diagnoses an error when the
	  second operand of a comma expression is an unresolved set of
	  overloaded functions.  Previously, it incorrectly used the
	  context of the comma expression to resolve the function. 
        </p><p><b>Uninstaller removed by upgrade. </b>
          The uninstaller could be incorrectly deleted during an
          upgrade on Microsoft Windows hosts.  This bug has been
          fixed.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging connection auto-retry. </b>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>target remote</strong></span> command within GDB now uses
	  a configurable auto-retry timeout when establishing TCP connections.
	  This is useful in avoiding race conditions when the remote
	  GDB stub or GDB server is launched simultaneously with GDB.
	  The auto-retry behavior is enabled by default; refer to the
	  GDB manual for details.
        </p><p><b>Extraneous linker error messages. </b>
	  A linker bug that caused extraneous error messages of the form
	  <code class="code">Dwarf Error: Offset (507) greater than or equal to
	 .debug_str size (421).</code> has been corrected.  This bug did not
	 affect the correctness of output binaries.
	</p><p><b>GDB segment warning. </b>
	  Some compilers produce binaries including uninitialized data
	  regions, such as the stack and heap.  GDB incorrectly
	  displayed the warning <code class="literal">Loadable segment
	  "<em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em>" outside of ELF
	  segments</code> for such binaries; the warning has now
	  been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler errors when optimizing. </b>
	  A defect that occasionally caused internal compiler errors
	  when partial redundancy elimination (PRE) optimization was
	  enabled has been corrected.
        </p><p><b><span class="command"><strong>m68k-uclinux-objcopy</strong></span> bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused
          <span class="command"><strong>m68k-uclinux-objcopy</strong></span> to issue an error
          when generating output in the Intel HEX format and using
          <code class="option">--change-section-lma</code> to change section
          addresses.
        </p><p><b>Linker script search path. </b>
          The bug in the linker has been fixed that caused it not to
          follow its documented behavior for searching for linker
          scripts named with the <code class="option">-T</code> option.  Now
          scripts are looked up first in the current directory, then
          in library directories specified with <code class="option">-L</code>
          command-line options, and finally in the default system
          linker script directory.
        </p><p><b>Install directory pathnames. </b>
          Bugs in the install and uninstall scripts for Linux
	  
	  hosts that caused errors or incorrect behavior when the
	  Sourcery G++ install directory pathname contains whitespace
	  characters have been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Temporary files on Microsoft Windows. </b>
	  On Microsoft Windows hosts, Sourcery G++ Lite now uses the standard
	  Windows algorithm to choose the directory in which to place
	  temporary files.  This change eliminates a crash that
	  occurred if none of the <code class="envar">TEMP</code>,
	  <code class="envar">TMP</code>, or <code class="envar">TMPDIR</code> variables were
	  set to a suitable directory.
        </p><p><b>Open Source BDM ColdFire support. </b>
	  Initial support for Open Source BDM (OSBDM) probes has been added
	  to the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite.  Both integrated and stand-alone
	  OSBDM probes are supported.  Using this feature requires installed
	  OSBDM drivers, which are currently only available for Windows hosts.
	  For more information, see <a class="xref" href="sec-sprite-osbdm-url.html" title="5.7. Open Source BDM Devices">Section 5.7, &#8220;Open Source BDM Devices&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error when optimizing. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused <code class="literal">internal compiler
	  error: in build2_stat</code> when compiling.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.19.51.20090205 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>GDB <span class="command"><strong>quit</strong></span> error. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that
	  caused <span class="command"><strong>quit</strong></span> to report <code class="literal">Quitting:
	  You can't do that without a process to debug.</code> when
	  debugging a core dump file.
	</p><p><b>Internal compiler error
        with <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code>. </b>
          An internal compiler error that occurred when using
          the <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code> option has been
          fixed.  The error occurred when compiling code with
          function-local <code class="code">static</code> array or structure
          variables.
        </p><p><b>Corruption of block-scope variables. </b>
          A compiler optimization bug that sometimes caused corruption of
	  stack-allocated variables has been fixed.  The bug affected 
	  variables declared in a local block scope in functions containing
	  multiple non-overlapping lexical block scopes, a technique
	  commonly used by programmers to reduce stack frame size.
	  In some rare cases, other optimizations performed by the
	  compiler were ignoring the local extent of such block-scope
	  variables.
        </p><p><b>Persistent remote server connections. </b>
	  A GDB bug has been fixed that caused the <span class="command"><strong>target
	  extended-remote</strong></span> command to fail to tell the
	  remote server to make the connection persistent across
	  program invocations.
	</p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20081022.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Pointer-to-member functions. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the C++ compiler to crash
	  when compiling a pointer-to-member function reference
	  without an explicit <code class="code">&amp;</code> operator.  This
	  syntax is allowed only when the
	  <code class="option">-fms-extensions</code> command-line option is
	  used.

	  A bug that caused the assembler to produce corrupted
	  listings (via the <code class="option">-a</code> option) on Windows
	  hosts has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GDB display of source. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that prevented GDB from locating debug
	  information in some cases.  The debugger failed to display
	  source code for or step into the affected functions.
	</p><p><b>Shared libraries bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused
          <code class="literal">Invalid instruction</code> errors in applications
          compiled with <code class="option">-mid-shared-library</code> for CPUs
          without hardware floating point.  The problem was caused by
          incorrect linker attributes on internal compiler-generated
          symbols in the shared library; you must rebuild both
          the application and shared libraries to pick up the fix.
        </p><p><b>Sprite crash on error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed which sometimes caused the Sourcery G++ Debug
	  Sprite to crash when it attempted to send an error message to
	  GDB.
        </p><p><b>ColdFire M54455 support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now includes optimized libraries for the ColdFire
          M54455 family of processors.  To select these libraries use
	  the <code class="option">-mcpu=54455</code> or related options.
        </p><p><b>Printing casted values in GDB. </b>
	  A GDB bug that caused incorrect output for expressions
	  containing casts, such as in the
	  <code class="literal">print *(Type *)ptr</code> command, has been fixed.
	</p><p><b>Bug fix for objcopy/strip. </b>
          An objcopy bug that corrupted COMDAT groups when creating new
	  binaries has been fixed.  This bug also affected
	  <span class="command"><strong>strip -g</strong></span>.
        </p><p><b>Binutils support for DWARF Version 3. </b>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>addr2line</strong></span> command now supports
	  binaries containing DWARF 3 debugging information.  The
	  <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> command can display error messages
	  with source locations for input files containing DWARF 3
	  debugging information.

	  compatible with the linker option <code class="option">--gc-sections</code>.
	  Previously, applications linked with <code class="option">--gc-sections</code>
	  terminated at startup with an illegal instruction error.
        </p><p><b>Code generation bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to generate
          invalid code which was rejected by the assembler with
          an <code class="literal">operands mismatch</code> error.
        </p><p><b>Errors after loading the debugged program. </b>
          An intermittent GDB bug has been fixed.  The bug could cause
	  a GDB internal error

        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id286654"></a>A.1.5. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 4.3-21</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20080821.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including support for decimal floating point,
	   the new <span class="command"><strong>find</strong></span> command to
	  search memory, the new <code class="option">/m</code> (mixed
	  source and assembly) option to the
	  <span class="command"><strong>disassemble</strong></span> command, and the new
	  <span class="command"><strong>macro define</strong></span> command to define C
	  preprocessor macros interactively.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging improvements. </b>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> utility now supports a more
	  efficient communications protocol that can reduce latency during
	  remote debugging.  The protocol optimizations are enabled
	  automatically when <span class="command"><strong>gdbserver</strong></span> operates over
	  a TCP connection.  Refer to the GDB manual for more information.
        </p><p><b>Output files removed on error. </b>
	  When GCC encounters an error, it now consistently removes
	  any incomplete output files that it may have created.
        </p><p><b>Memory access errors when setting breakpoints. </b>
	  A GDB bug that caused spurious "Cannot access memory" errors
	  has been fixed.  The errors occurred when setting
	  breakpoints after the program being debugged exited or was
	  killed.
	</p><p><b>Cache control. </b>
          A bug in the Debug Sprite has been fixed that previously
	  caused failures when stepping over breakpoints on V3, V4 and
	  V4e cores when caching is enabled.
        </p><p><b>Processor status register display. </b>
	  When displaying the status register, both GDB and the 
	  Sourcery G++ IDE now list the names of flags that are set.
	  Previously, a decimal number was displayed.
        </p><p><b>Object file mismatch when linking. </b>
          A bug in uClibc that caused link failures with some
          <code class="option">-march</code> or <code class="option">-mcpu</code> option
	  values has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.3.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire uClinux is now based on GCC version 4.3.2.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.2 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Sprite communication improvements. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now uses a more efficient protocol
	  for communicating with GDB.  This can result in less latency
	  when debugging, especially when running the Sprite on a remote
	  machine over a network connection.
        </p><p><b>Bug fix for objdump on Windows. </b>
          An objdump bug that caused the <code class="option">-S</code> option
          not to work on Windows in some cases has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Support for MCF5227x processors. </b>
	  Support has been added for the ColdFire MCF5227x
	  (DragonFire0) family of microprocessors.  To compile for the
	  MCF52274 or MCF52277 processor, use
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=52274</code> or
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=52277</code>, respectively.
